                "review_text": "I love this Samsung J7. I couldn't afford the sticker price for the S6 or S7 (sticker shock!). Therefore; I opted for this which is scaled down in terms of processing/memory BUT it's much better quality than the phone I was using for my Boost Mobile account. I had no issues charging it or switching it over from old phone to this new phone - via my online account (I didn't have to talk to anybody to do this and it worked out just great). My hubby has the Samsung S6 which he saved/paid for upfront (no contract at Boost Mobile). Comparing my new J7 to his S6 - well; apples to oranges. His has 2 processors (a quad-core and an octa-core). This J7 has just the octa-core BUT for me is proving to be plenty of processing power along with the 2GB ROM. This was pretty comparable to the ZTE Warp Elite I've been using since January 2016 but I'd have to say that the Samsung is much faster - also that the screen response is so much better in this J7 model (even with the glass protection I placed on the screen). My hubby bought me this for my upcoming 60th birthday! GREAT present for me.....all mine! Thank you 'shopcelldeals' for selling this at a reasonable price that was affordable. Recommended.",

                "review_text": "This phone is one of the best I have had from Virgin Mobile, and know it would be better with T-Mobile or another GSM carrier with the extra specs those add. The camera is very nice for such a cheap phone, 13mp in the back, 5mp in the front. Works well in relatively low lighting and doesn't begin to look grainy until it's obviously much too dark, such as outside in the night with a fire for just light like the stone ages. Anyway, it's not the best camera, but definitely better than the LG Volt and LG G Stylo I had had before this one. The screen isn't brilliantly bright and crisp, but I promise it doesn't look horribly. The screen is big, but not too big, more comfortable than the LG G Stylo in my personal opinion, but if you like \"Phablets\", this is a big small, but you'd probably get used to it. The ram is only 1gb in the Virgin Mobile edition, and only 4.5gb of internal storage available to the user, even though it advertises 8gb. The other phone with the GSM carriers have 2gb of ram, and 16gb or storage with only 10gb or so left for the users accessibility. It comes with Lollipop, although I am sure the Marshmellow update wouldn't be long to hit considering it did hit the LG G Stylo quickly, and this phone is the 2015 successor of the Moto G lineups. The phone is able to be rooted, although I do not advise for it will void your warranty with Motorola and possibly Virgin Mobile, so you should know what you are doing. However, this should be brought up because Virgin Mobile carries a variety of cheap phones, but they are mostly LG. LG should not be rooted because they end up killing over and are touchy. Motorola is more laid back, and it should be noted so people know what they should and shouldn't if they are not experienced and want to try new things. Yes, this phone is water resistant, but not water proof. You can not swim with it and epect to use it under water. This is purely for accidents only. You can use this near water and if something splashes on it, it will be fine. You must remember to seal the back near the camera and the edges, or it will completely useless and you will lose your phone to water damage. The biggest con is the bit of crashes I have experienced on such little use. The play store crashes immediately when trying to type, and many other things end up crashing. This may not be a problem to all, but to me it was and should be noted. This does have an LED to those who care about that little helpful feature, however it is not able to be used for anything other than battery purposes, so you don't get anything very helpful from it. There is the feature Moto Display which shows your notifications on the screen in a specific way and there are settings for you to mess with. Over all this phone is a very great phone for the price and something that people can greatly appreciate for a low budget.",

It got to the point where I was so sick of buying hundred plus dollar phones that would crap out by 6 months glitching, memory problems, data problems, etcetera. I've tried all of the LGs they are okay but very hit-and-miss. My last LG experience with a LG Stylo which I thought was going to be a great phone until it would randomly, not receive text messages from important people. I had read about that in many of the reviews on that phone so I took a chance and to my surprise it happened to me too. It may not sound like a huge deal to some but it can really leave you in a predicament. That was the last straw. I have only had this phone a couple of months but so far I have not been disappointed. Aesthetically it's nothing fancy. But the camera is really nice phone, calls are really decent and browsing the web and multiple apps very fast. this is a nice size phone not too big like the stylo not too small at all. This is very colorful compared to any of the LG's I've ever had. Way better then the HTC phones I've owned as well. This phone is an excellent deal and the best Bang for your buck.",

As my ZTE phone started to have problems I decided to look for a new phone. I was willing to dump Virgin Mobile as long as I got a good phone with a competitive pricing plan. My research came to the Moto G 3rd gen as a budget phone with a great camera and battery life. It happened to be available on Virgin Mobile which lead to me keeping their service. The moto gestures are neat. I love the camera interface. Simply touching the screen takes photos, holding your finger can take burst photos. There is a lot to like. The screen is colorful and reactive. Overall I really love this phone. The only thing I don't like is that a program called Mobile ID always displays an error message in your notices. I tried to disable that message but then you get weird errors frequently when touching the screen. So I switched it back to the error message in the notices which is relatively a minor nuisance. Virgin for some reason did not roll out the android 6.0 update on this phone although it s available on other carriers. According to Motorola's site the Virgin Moto G 3rd gen should get the android 7.0 update. I won't hold my breath but, I'm hopeful that will fi that one annoying issue. Overall this is a great phone. I bought two more for my wife and kid and ordered them custom back panels from Motorola.",

I connected mine with Windows 8.1 to a 1920 x 1080 monitor. You have the usual screen options, you can mirror the screen, extend the displays, or use the external or internal monitor as the only one. With Windows 8.1 you can quickly get to this menu through the Charms, then \"Project\" (verb). The software needed lives on the actual StarTech cable. When you first connect it to your PC, it recognizes it as a USB drive, around 8MB occupied by the EXE file that has the software. Depending on how your Auto Play settings (default or otherwise) are setup, you may have to manually run this file. This installs the necessary software and then requests a reboot to complete the installation. Once rebooted, you can go to the Windows menus and customize it. If your laptop is 1366 x 768, you will only get 1366 x 768 on your external monitor if you mirror. If you select Extend or Second Display Only, you will get the full resolution of the screen (1920 x 1080 in my case). The maximum it can support is 1920 x 1200 but I don't have that resolution to test it. It comes in a cardboard box, with the device and a postcard size Quick Install Guide with small print.",

Instead of shipping a CD/DVD install disk, the software is integrated into the device. This could become a new design pattern in which versioning and manufacturing for software-enabled devices incorporate the drivers onboard. So, a neat idea. The driver in installed on this device was auto-detected on one of my HP HPE-480t Windows 7 desktops. It will prompt you for installation activities. But it was not auto-detected on my HP Spectre running Windows 10 Pro. (I have seen USB device related issues with Windows 10 as of this post, so it's hard to know where to point fingers). In this case, you'll see the device in the Printers and Devices section, but it will not show as a removable drive like a USB storage stick. You can try the Windows device troubleshooter (Windows knows the driver is missing or bad) and tell it to download a driver, but that didn't work for me even after a reboot. Solution: Go to the Startech website and unzip the driver. There's a setup.exe for you to run, a la early 90's. That worked. Yes, USB is a CPU cycle-stealing protocol -- yes, I was all in for Firewire. So an older machine can be a problem, and you need a USB3.x port. Using a hub might be a problem; though it worked on the Win7 desktop, I didn't try it on the laptop as that would have confused matters. Warranty is 2 years. Make sure you have an antivirus scanner active to check the driver when it's installed. Since the monitor you use will have varying resolution, you will probably have more adjusting to do after it's installed, or just accept some black space around the image. Disclaimer from the manufacturer: \"This USB video adapter uses a Fresco family chipset. If you\u2019re connecting this device to a computer along with additional USB video adapters or docking stations, please avoid using devices with a DisplayLink or Trigger family chipset.\" I am glad to have this in my laptop toolbox, and for some people it will save one of the possible needs for a more costly docking station. Once installed, the main issue for laptop use is to see if you're willing to carry along a VGA cable to pair with a monitor. (It's increasingly an HDMI world out there, so watch the shifting standards).",
